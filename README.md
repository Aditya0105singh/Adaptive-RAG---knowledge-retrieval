# Adaptive RAG AI: Dynamic Query Routing & Retrieval System

### What We Made
A full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that uploads documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, CSV) and lets you ask questions in natural language. It is built with a **FastAPI** backend orchestrating a stateful **LangGraph** pipeline, and a custom **Streamlit + HTML/JS** frontend that supports real-time Server-Sent Events (SSE) token streaming.

### What Makes It Unique
Unlike a naive RAG system that blindly runs vector database searches for every single question, this system evaluates query intent first to optimize speed and relevance:
*   **Dynamic Tri-Routing**: An LLM intent classifier routes the query down the most optimal path: Document Retrieval (local Qdrant index), Live Web Search (Tavily fallback), or General Knowledge reasoning (direct LLM).
*   **Self-Correcting Retrieval Loop**: If document search returns chunks below a relevance threshold (0.6), the system uses an LLM to rewrite the query and retries the search. If it still fails, it seamlessly falls back to a web search.
*   **Single-Batch Relevance Grading & Fast Path**: Instead of calling the LLM sequentially for each chunk, it grades all chunks in one batch. If the first retrieve score is extremely low (< 0.3), it triggers a fast-path bypass straight to Web Search, saving seconds of latency.
*   **Mid-Stream Provider Fallback**: If the primary LLM (Groq Llama 3.3) hits rate limits mid-generation, the SSE stream catches the error, sends backspace characters to clear the screen, switches to fallback models (Gemini/Cerebras/Cohere), and continues generation seamlessly.
*   **Grounding Ablation**: Sentences in the final answer are checked for hallucinations. Users can inspect LLM-based sentence grading side-by-side with a fast, zero-cost, local vector embedding similarity calculator.

## How it Works

The backend uses **LangGraph** to model the decision flow as a state machine. When a question is submitted, the system classifies its intent and takes one of three routes:

1.  **Document Index**: Queries specific to the uploaded file. Runs semantic search on Qdrant, grades retrieval relevance, and rewrites the query if the match is too weak.
2.  **Web Search**: Triggered if no document is uploaded, if the document retrieval relevance fails the threshold, or if the user asks for real-time information (e.g. stock prices, current events). Powered by Tavily.
3.  **General Reasoning**: Straight LLM generation for general chitchat, greetings, coding help, or math. This completely bypasses vector databases, saving latency.

## Core Design Choices

### Parent-Child Chunking
Single-size chunking forces a trade-off: small chunks match search queries precisely but lack context, while large chunks preserve context but dilute search relevance. 
To resolve this:
*   I split documents into **Parent Chunks** of 1,500 characters (~300 words, 200 overlap) and **Child Chunks** of 400 characters (~80 words, 50 overlap).
*   Only the child chunks are embedded and indexed in Qdrant.
*   Each child chunk's metadata stores the ID and full text of its parent.
*   At query time, the system retrieves the top child matches, maps them to their parents, deduplicates the parent IDs (so multiple child hits from the same section don't clutter the prompt), and sends the unique parent chunks to the LLM.

### Multi-Provider LLM Fallback Pool
To handle API rate limits (which happen often when testing Llama 3.3 on Groq's free-tier 6,000 TPM limit), I built a resilient fallback sequence:
`Groq (Key Rotation Pool) -> Gemini 2.0 Flash -> Cerebras (Gemma 31B) -> Cohere Command-R`
*   **Mid-Stream Recovery**: If a rate limit error is raised mid-generation, the Server-Sent Events (SSE) generator catches it. It measures the character count emitted so far, sends backspace characters (`\x08`) to clean up the partial text on the client's screen, switches to the next LLM provider, and resumes streaming the response.
*   **Custom Cerebras Adapter**: The standard LangChain OpenAI adapter triggers Pydantic schema validation conflicts across dependencies, so I wrote a custom, direct HTTP handler using raw requests and SSE yield loops.

### Single-Batch Relevance Grading & The "Fast Path"
Instead of sending sequential LLM calls to grade each retrieved document chunk (which adds tons of latency), the system sends a single batched prompt. It sends the query and a numbered list of all retrieved chunks, asking the LLM to return a raw JSON float array of scores (e.g. `[0.85, 0.20, 0.90]`).
*   **Relevance Threshold**: Chunks with scores $\ge 0.6$ are kept. 
*   **The Fast Path**: If the best chunk retrieved on the first attempt scores $< 0.3$, it usually means the document has no information on the topic. The system skips the query-rewriting loop entirely and jumps straight to Web Search, saving 1–2 seconds.

### Grounding Evaluator (Ablation Comparison)
I built two alternative grounding modes to check for hallucinations:
1.  **LLM Grounding**: Splits the generated answer into sentences and runs parallel LLM calls (`ThreadPoolExecutor` with 6 workers) to classify each sentence as `GROUNDED` (explicitly backed by sources), `INFERRED` (logical deduction), or `UNGROUNDED` (hallucination).
2.  **Embedding-based Grounding (Ablation)**: Runs zero LLM calls. It calculates cosine similarity between each sentence vector and the retrieved source vectors. It maps scores $\ge 0.75 \implies$ GROUNDED, $\ge 0.50 \implies$ INFERRED, and $< 0.50 \implies$ UNGROUNDED. 
The UI exposes a `/api/grounding/compare` endpoint to compare the speed and accuracy of both approaches side-by-side.

### Knowledge Gap Analyzer
If the context isn't fully comprehensive, the LLM analyzes what is missing. It outputs a Trust Score (0-100%), up to 4 missing points, and suggests what other documents the user should upload (e.g., "Upload your resume or W2 form"). These results are cached using an MD5 hash of `Question + Digests of Retrieved Chunks` with a 600-second TTL to prevent duplicate calls.

## Frontend & UI Implementation

*   **Fixed Viewport Layout**: Streamlit iframes do not support standard `position:fixed` CSS properties cleanly. I bypassed this by writing a custom Flexbox column layout where the chat input wrapper is pinned to the bottom. An iframe-side `MutationObserver` listens for new message cards and triggers `postMessage('streamlit:setFrameHeight')` to resize the viewport container dynamically.
*   **Voice Input**: Integrated browser-native SpeechRecognition (`WebSpeechAPI`). I injected a raw value setter into the React DOM prototype of the Streamlit text area to ensure text injected by voice input triggers React's state handlers.
*   **Session Stats & Costs**: Added a live sidebar dashboard that aggregates total session queries, route counts, average response latency, and calculates the exact cost in USD based on actual token usage counts and model pricing tables.

## Benchmarks & Evaluation

I evaluated this adaptive pipeline against a **Naive RAG baseline** (which always retrieves, runs no grading, and uses single-shot generation) on the same document set and evaluation queries. Performance was measured using the **[RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io)** framework, judged by `llama-3.1-8b-instant`.

### RAGAS Evaluation Results

| Metric | Naive RAG | Adaptive RAG | Δ (Improvement) |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Faithfulness** | 0.759 | **0.816** | **+7%** |
| **Context Precision** | 0.875 | **1.000** | **+14%** |
| **Answer Relevancy** | 0.528 | 0.500 | ~Tied |
| **Avg Latency (ms)** | 1089 | 4773 | +3.7× (due to routing + grading steps) |

*The relevance grader filters out off-topic text chunks before generation, leading to **perfect context precision (1.000)** and higher faithfulness. The trade-off is higher latency due to the extra LLM calls for classification and grading.*

### Routing Accuracy & Latency Per Route
Tested via `evaluate/test_routing.py` (25-question labeled test set):
*   **Routing Accuracy**: **25/25 (100%)**
*   **Measured End-to-End Latency** (wall-clock, including network):

| Route | sample count | Average Latency | P50 | P95 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| **Index (Document)** | 3 | 5,813 ms | 4,910 ms | 7,782 ms |
| **General Reasoning** | 3 | 7,737 ms | 8,376 ms | 9,052 ms |
| **Web Search** | 3 | 5,278 ms | 5,493 ms | 5,513 ms |
| **Overall** | **9** | **6,276 ms** | **5,513 ms** | **9,052 ms** |

## Known Bugs Fixed

During development, I fixed several critical layout, token rate, and connection bugs:

| Bug | Root Cause | Resolution |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| Chat input invisible on refresh | `position:fixed` behaves inconsistently inside Streamlit iframes | Rewrote UI using a pure CSS Flexbox layout |
| Viewport clipping reasoning logs | Absolute positioning of the reasoning badge was clipped by `.card` overflow limits | Moved the reasoning status dot to render inline |
| Cohere vector upload crashes | Ingestion service sent batches of 100 texts, exceeding Cohere's API batch limit of 96 | Reduced vector processing batch size to 90 |
| Stream drops on Render proxy | Render's reverse proxy kills HTTP connections if idle for 30 seconds | Added a background task that yields keepalive comments (`: keepalive\n\n`) every 5 seconds |
| Rapid API quota exhaustion | LLM execution defaulted to a `max_tokens` limit of 32,768, which filled up TPM budgets | Capped default generation tokens to 1,024 |
| Slow routing on startup | Fast API and LangGraph loaded heavy local PyTorch dependencies | Switched to ONNX runtime (`fastembed`) and mocked PyTorch imports during execution |

```
data: {"type": "stage", "stage": "routing"}
data: {"type": "stage", "stage": "retrieving"}
data: {"type": "stage", "stage": "grading"}
data: {"type": "stage", "stage": "generating"}

## Future Work (Deferred Tasks)

*   **Render Cold-Start Ping**: Render free tier instances sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. I plan to set up a free UptimeRobot monitor checking `/health` every 14 minutes to keep the container awake.
*   **Qdrant Free-Tier Activity**: Qdrant shuts down free clusters after 30 days without API activity. If needed, I can refactor the vector factory in `database.py` to run fully in-memory locally.
*   **Session History Caching**: Currently, refreshing the browser page wipes all session history inside the frontend iframe. Moving chat logs to `sessionStorage` would fix this issue.
